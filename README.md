# Purpose

Make a Pachinko game in accordance with [this reference](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-sprite-pachinko?uv=2021.3&pathwayId=5f7bcab4edbc2a0023e9c38f&missionId=5f777d9bedbc2a001f6f5ec7&projectId=5fa5be27edbc2a001f01b3f0#). The concept is basically that you have rows of things blocking something from falling onto something else below.

## Our creative twist

The game is dropping something onto the commoner. He moves around in accordance with some state diagram I'm not sure about yet. We should add some sounds too. He's all happy and just moving around and then the player drops something onto his head and he gets angry.
